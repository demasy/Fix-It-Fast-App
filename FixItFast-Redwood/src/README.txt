ADDITIONAL INSTALLATION INFORMATION
-----------------------------------
Having scaffolded a web app using this template zip with above “ojet create” command, follow these instructions 
1.	Enable PWA Configuration 
Add Progressive Web App to your app 
1.1.	Change to the application’s root directory(i.e. cd FixItFast)
1.2.	Add pwa configuration by running below command

ojet add pwa

This adds a reference to the service worker code in src/index.html, and adds the manifest.json and sw.js files, which make this app available to scan/download for direct usage in any other device for running with PWA supported browser.

2.	Building the app

For building the app , use below command
 ojet build
The above command creates a web folder with all the configuration needed for application to be served and deployed.

3.	Launch the application
The following command will launch PWA enable FixItFast application in the default web browser with live reload enabled.
ojet serve
The application will be hosted on localhost with the default port of 8000. Make any desired code change in the /src folder, and the browser will update automatically to reflect the changes after you save the files.

4.	PWA Usage Criteria
For your application to be installable , below points are to be taken care of 
a.	Browser should support PWA. Google Chrome, Apple Safari, Firefox for Android, and Microsoft Edge but not Firefox for desktop.
b.	You should have valid manifest along with valid service worker. The “ojet add pwa” command in step 1 created these files. 
c.	Make sure any icons listed in manifest file are also available in the app at provided path.
d.	The application hosting site should be using HTTPS with an SSL certificate of your choosing. Local development can use HTTP for your page and service worker script via http://localhost[:port] without any further actions.

Once all the above criteria is fulfilled , you will see install icon in browser's address bar.
 
On installation , app will be available for usage in device. Along with the install icon you will also have barcode available to scan and use the same in other devices .
5.	Adding app to Home Screen for mobile device
5.1.	Android 
On serving the app in chrome or any other browser on an Android device, an install banner "Add to Home screen" will appear allowing to run the PWA app directly from your device home screen in the future. On proceeding, the app will be installed with a Google on the fly signed .APK file.

If Chrome encounters any issue with the HTTPS certificate or service worker, it will not show the install banner. An icon can still be added to the home screen through the "Add to home screen" option available in browser menu, and the icon will open the app without address bar. The difference is that it’s just a bookmark link, not an .apk file generated by WebApk in Chrome.

5.2.	iOS
Manually add the PWA to your Home screen, Tap the Share button (in the browser options), From the options tap the Add to Home screen option, you can notice an icon of the website or screenshot of website added to your devices home screen instantly.

6.	Uninstalling App
The FixItFast PWA app can be uninstalled like any other installed app on you device.
